    "description": "In 2023, I won first place in Coastal's speech competition for young professionals by proposing an AI committee focused on developing policies and employee education. As a result, a comprehensive AI policy was created, and a working group was established in 2024 to identify, pilot, and facilitate the adoption of AI solutions. My success in the competition also allowed me to represent Coastal at Crash the GAC, where I engaged with experts on economic trends and advocated for key issues affecting credit unions and their members.",
